Inspired by the mighty Siraj - https://github.com/llSourcell/100_Days_of_ML_Code


## So here we are!

I'll be using Google COLAB for this and publishing here on GitHub.

**Day 1** - Linear Regression on a single variable using NumPy.

**Day 2** - (Re)learnt about Multiple Linear Regression and Multivariate Linear Regression. 
            Started coding up the latter...
            
*[Queue]*

**Day 2** - Linear Regression on multiple variables using NumPy.

**Day 3** - Logistic Regression
