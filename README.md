# 100DaysOfML

Inspired by the mighty Siraj - https://github.com/llSourcell/100_Days_of_ML_Code


## So here we are!

I'll be using Google COLAB for this and publishing here on GitHub.

Day | Notes | Code
----|-------|-----
**1** | Linear Regression on a single variable using NumPy. | [1_numpy_linearRegression.ipynb](1_numpy_linearRegression.ipynb)
**2** | (Re)learnt about Multiple Linear Regression and Multivariate Linear Regression. Started coding up the latter and getting CoLAB to cooperate with Google Drive files.
**3** | Got Linear Regression working using NumPy. | [2_numpy_linearRegression_with_CostFn.ipynb](2_numpy_linearRegression_with_CostFn.ipynb)
